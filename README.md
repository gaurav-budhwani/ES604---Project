# ES604---Project
##  Overview
This project focuses on optimizing heat loss and thermal boundary layer thickness in laminar airflow over a heated flat plate. It employs computational tools like Pyomo (Python) and MATLAB to model and solve optimization problems in convective heat transfer. The primary goal is to enhance thermal efficiency while adhering to physical and operational constraints.
